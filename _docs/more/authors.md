Anemone platform is a result of cooperation between [Developers from Česká Spořitelna](https://developers.csas.cz) and [Juicymo](https://www.juicymo.cz).

It could never be created without support of guys from [Česká Spořitelna](https://developers.csas.cz), mainly [Honza Sechovec](https://twitter.com/jansechovec) and  [Jakub Dubrovský](https://twitter.com/Jakubdubrovsky).

Anemone has been created with love in Prague.

## Special thanks

For their great effort we owe a BIG thank you to the following people and entities from the joint project development team (everybody did *a lot more* then what was expected from him):

* *[Pedro Pinto da Silva](http://pedropintosilva.com)* for the outstanding graphical design of the entire platform including website, mobile app, Arduino app UI and infographics. This platform design has a story.
* *[Martin Svoboda](https://github.com/svobom57)* for the development of Anemone Cloud Ruby on Rails application, background jobs processing and flow editor internals.
* *[Michal Mlejnek](https://github.com/chaemil)* for the huge amount of Anemone Tentacle 3D case model iterations in Blender - including the final one which you can print and enjoy. Michal also created all the frontend JS code for the flow editor.
* *[Jana Moudrá](https://github.com/Janamou)* for coding the Anemone platform presentational website (the one at [https://www.anemone.cloud](https://www.anemone.cloud)). Fully responsive with all the cute JS features.
* *[Jakub Dubrovský](https://twitter.com/Jakubdubrovsky)* for the daily communication and cooperation.
* *[Honza Sechovec](https://github.com/jsechovec)* for the vision, guidance.
* *[Tomáš Jukin](http://github.com/Inza)* for the platform architecture and the fact that all the stuff fits well together. And for the ugly electronical stuff, the documentation, slicing, soldering and 3D printing.
* *Kanárek* (which is a [Prusa3D i3 MK2S 3D printer](http://www.prusa3d.cz/#i3-printer)) for printing every single iteration of the Anemone Tentacle 3D case model and still work.

## Used technologies

> "They say great science is built on the shoulders of giants." -- Cave Johnson
