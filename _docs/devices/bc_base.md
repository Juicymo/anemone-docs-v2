## Introduction

*BigClown Base Tentacle* allows you to read various data and send it to your [Flow](/cloud/flows). It has a modular sensor architecture (sensors in BigClown world are called *Tags*). BigClown Base Tentacle does not have ability to connect itself to the internet *(therefore to the Anemone Cloud)* directly. You will need to connect it to your computer or RaspberryPi via USB cable or wirelessly to the [BigClown USB Dongle](https://shop.bigclown.com/usb-dongle/).

## How to build

### Components

The following components are needed for your *BigClown Base Tentacle*:

1. `1x` The [Core Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/core-module/)
2. `1x` The [Power Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/power-module/)
3. `1x` The [Base Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/base-module/) *(but the bottom part of this case is replacing it)*
4. `1x` USB-A to micro-USB cable

You can add up to 3 individual [sensor tags](https://shop.bigclown.com/search/?string=tag) as needed.

## How to use

> **Support for this Tentacle Coming Soon!** But [a cute 3D Printable Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2679107) for it can be [downloaded](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2679107) right now.

On the other hand *BigClown Base Tentacle* can receive wireless data from the rest of your BigClown network (for example from the [BigClown (BC) Remote Tentacle](#bigclown-bc-remote-tentacle), the [BigClown USB Dongle](https://shop.bigclown.com/usb-dongle/) can be used for that purpose as well).

> BigClown Tentacles are more complex, versatile and robust than the low-cost tentacles based on NodeMCU v2. BigClown Tentacles have industrial quality. But all of this comes for a cost. BigClown Tentacles are also more expensive.

You can find more about the [BigClown devices](https://www.bigclown.com/kits/) on the [BigClown website](https://www.bigclown.com/).
