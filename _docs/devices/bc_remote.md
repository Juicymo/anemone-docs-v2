## Introduction

*BigClown Remote Tentacle* allows you to read various data and send it to your [Flow](/cloud/flows). It has a modular sensor architecture (sensors in BigClown world are called *Tags*). BigClown Remote Tentacle does not have ability to connect itself to the internet *(therefore to the Anemone Cloud)* directly. You will need to connect it wirelessly to the [BigClown Base Tentacle](#bigclown-bc-base-tentacle) or directly to the [BigClown USB Dongle](https://shop.bigclown.com/usb-dongle/).

## How to build

### Components

The following components are needed for your *BigClown Remote Tentacle*:

1. `1x` The [Core Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/core-module/)
2. `1x` The [Tag Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/tag-module/)
3. `1x` The [Battery Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/battery-module/)
4. `4x` The AAA battery

On the other hand *BigClown Remote Tentacle* is **the ONLY Tentacle which can operate completelly wirelessly**. It can collect data and send them over radio. It is povered by four AAA batteries.

> BigClown Tentacles are more complex, versatile and robust than the low-cost tentacles based on NodeMCU v2. BigClown Tentacles have industrial quality. But all come for a cost. BigClown Tentacles are also more expensive.
