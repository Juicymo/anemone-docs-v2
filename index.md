#### Open Hardware Devices

Anemone platform currently supports two open hardware devices based on [nodeMCU v2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NodeMCU-v2-Lua-based-ESP8266-development-kit-p-2415.html) by default (we call them **Tentacles**). But any open hardware device which is capable of using MQTT can be connected to the Anemone Platform.

Right now two low-cost hobby Tentacles based on [nodeMCU v2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NodeMCU-v2-Lua-based-ESP8266-development-kit-p-2415.html) are supported - a *button* and *display*. But support for an industrial quality devices from the [BigClown family](https://www.bigclown.com/) is coming soon.
